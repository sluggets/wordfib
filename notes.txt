Once all words and definitions have been uploaded, need to do these
things:


Need to implement a button to "Gimme a new word!"
Also more links on pages for scoreboard, and homepage
Generally just need a nice menu with three buttons: Scoreboard, Homepage, New Word.

Change points scored for wordfibbing someone else to 2!

Maybe have a period of time where only definition submissions are allowed
and no gameplay is allowed since there just aren't enough fake 
definitions to work with.


If some cheating chump tries to vote on their own definition, a stern reprimand occurs and a deduction of points!!!

Need to handle validation , i.e. if submit without username, or voting on one's own created definition, also HTML-escape all user submissions to avoid the haxoring!

Need to have a snippet that tells you what points you get for what!

***DONE***Grabbing scores from the fake definiton table:
    make a list from fake defs filtered by username:
        fake_defs_by_user = FakeDefinitions.objects.filter(author='ltim')
        score = 0
        for defs in fake_defs_by_user:
            score += defs.score()***DONE***

***DONE***Only allow words to be displayed for multiple choice if there are at least
three fake definitions in addition to the real definition(so, a total of four defs)***DONE***

***DONE***Find a new random function to select a word. Current random function will break if/when words are inevitibly deleted for whatever reason.***DONE***

***DONE***Need to have redirect handled after entering a def. Should show home page with a thank you for entering a definition and an offer to play again if you want***DONE***

***DONE***Make input fields focus purple, not blue.***DONE***
