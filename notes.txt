Once all words and definitions have been uploaded, need to do these
things:




***DONE***Need to implement a button to "Gimme a new word!"
Also more links on pages for scoreboard, and homepage
Generally just need a nice menu with three buttons: Scoreboard, Homepage, New Word.***DONE***


***DONE***Maybe have a period of time where only definition submissions are allowed
and no gameplay is allowed since there just aren't enough fake 
definitions to work with.***DONE***


***DONE***If some cheating chump tries to vote on their own definition, a stern reprimand occurs and a deduction of points!!!***DONE***


Need to have a snippet that tells you what points you get for what!

***DONE***Need to handle validation , i.e. if submit without username, or voting on one's own created definition, also HTML-escape all user submissions to avoid the haxoring!***DONE***

***DONE***Grabbing scores from the fake definiton table:
    make a list from fake defs filtered by username:
        fake_defs_by_user = FakeDefinitions.objects.filter(author='ltim')
        score = 0
        for defs in fake_defs_by_user:
            score += defs.score()***DONE***

***DONE***Only allow words to be displayed for multiple choice if there are at least
three fake definitions in addition to the real definition(so, a total of four defs)***DONE***

***DONE***Find a new random function to select a word. Current random function will break if/when words are inevitibly deleted for whatever reason.***DONE***

***DONE***Need to have redirect handled after entering a def. Should show home page with a thank you for entering a definition and an offer to play again if you want***DONE***

***DONE***Make input fields focus purple, not blue.***DONE***

***DONE***Change points scored for wordfibbing someone else to 2!***DONE***

***DONE***Need to process username and ESPECIALLY user-submitted definitions. We gonnna do these three things:
    1) lower case all the shit
    2) strip any whitespace after last letter (rstrip())
    3) strip anything that is not a space or a period or an apostrophe? (''.join(c for c in definition if c.islower() or c == ' ' or c == '.' or c == "'")
    4) add in a period at the end of definition. (if definition[-1] != '.': definition += '.'
    5) ensure full_clean() to protect against blank submissions, pretty up the validation warnings***DONE***

***DONE***Title should be link to get back to home page***DONE***
