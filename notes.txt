Grabbing scores from the fake definiton table:
    make a list from fake defs filtered by username:
        fake_defs_by_user = FakeDefinitions.objects.filter(author='ltim')
        score = 0
        for defs in fake_defs_by_user:
            score += defs.score()

Need to implement a button to "Gimme a new word!"

Once all words and definitions have been uploaded, need to do these
things:

Maybe have a period of time where only definition submissions are allowed
and no gameplay is allowed since there just aren't enough fake 
definitions to work with.

Only allow words to be displayed for multiple choice if there are at least
three fake definitions in addition to the real definition(so, a total of four defs)

Find a new random function to select a word. Current random function will break if/when words are inevitibly deleted for whatever reason.

***DONE***Need to have redirect handled after entering a def. Should show home page with a thank you for entering a definition and an offer to play again if you want***DONE***

If some cheating chump tries to vote on their own definition, a stern reprimand occurs and a deduction of points!!!
